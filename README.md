# 🌺 FlowerDex - AI-Powered Flower Identifier App

FlowerDex is a Flutter application powered by Google Gemini AI that allows users to identify flowers in real-time by simply snapping a picture. The app sends the image to a Python FastAPI backend, which uses Gemini to analyze the image and return the species name, confidence percentage, and an interesting flower fact.

## 🚀 Features
	•	Identify flowers from a photo
	•	AI-generated flower names and fun facts
	•	Confidence score from the AI model
	•	Clean and responsive Flutter UI
